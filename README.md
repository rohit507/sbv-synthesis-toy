# Embedded Design Generation - Toy Example #

This is a simplified version of the process behind Embedded Design Generation.
In particular, it allows you to generate sets of constraints which map to
portions of the Embedded System design space.

There is extensive documentation in the code itself, explaining both the
motivations behind each construct as well as the implementation itself.
